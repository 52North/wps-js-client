wps-js-client
=============

Standalone Javascript OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) Client that utilizes the [wps-js](https://github.com/52North/wps-js) JavaScript API to grant access to Web Processing functionality via a user-friendly interface. It is built using JQuery, Boostrap and Angular and offers the following functions:

-	Configure available WPS instances
-	Use an intuitive HTML form-based Interface to build and execute typical request against WPS 1.0.0 and WPS 2.0.0 instances (GetCapabilities, DescribeProcess, Execute, getStatus, getResult)
-	Display of WPS responses via HTML form elements (Capabilities, ProcessDescription, Execute ResponseDocument (WPS 1.0), Execute ResultDocument (WPS 2.0), StatusInfo Document)

Requirements to develop or build the client
-------------------------------------------

-	git
-	[nodejs](https://nodejs.org)
-	[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
-	[grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)

Installation
----------------------------

Open the command line and navigate to a location, where you want to download the repository.

-	Check out the code: `git clone https://github.com/52North/wps-js-client.git`
- navigate into repository (`cd wps-js-client`)
-	run `npm install` to get/install all dependencies
- run `grunt` or `grunt buildWar` to build the application (see section 'Building options' for more details)
-	Deploy it on a Web server (e.g. content from `dist` folder or as .WAR file as described above)
-	Launch the application and see what you can do.

Basic usage
----------------------------

* First, you might want to change the language in the dropdown menu on the right.

1. Select a WebProcessingService:
![Alt text](https://github.com/cDanowski/wps-js-client/blob/master/screenshots/WPS_selection.png "WPS selection")
In this example, we select the geoprocessing service.
    
    * Optionally, you can then select Capabilities in the progress bar on the top right to get further information about Identification, Provider and Operations of the selected WebProcessingService.

2. Then go to Processes in the progress bar on the top and select one of the available processes which you want to make use of:
![Alt text](https://github.com/cDanowski/wps-js-client/blob/master/screenshots/Process_selection.png "Process selection")
In this example, we select the SimpleBufferAlgorithm.

    * The client requests information about the selected process. Optionally, you can select General Information, Inputs, or Outputs to get further information about the selected process.

3. Then go to the Execute progress on the top right and click on "Step 1: Configuration of Inputs."
The number of mandatory Inputs for the selected process is presented. 
    1. Click on the "Select Input" dropdown-menu and select a mandatory Input:
    ![Alt text](https://github.com/cDanowski/wps-js-client/blob/master/screenshots/Select_input.png "Input selection")
    In this example, we select the "data" input, which is mandatory for the SimpleBufferAlgorithm.

    2. Select the Format/MimeType of the input:
    ![Alt text](https://github.com/cDanowski/wps-js-client/blob/master/screenshots/geojson_selection.png "Geojson format selection")
    In this example, we select the application/vnd.geo+json format. The geojson format allows the input in one of four ways. Per default, "Digitalisation (map based specification)" is selected:
    ![Alt text](https://github.com/cDanowski/wps-js-client/blob/master/screenshots/digitalisation_setup.png "Digitalisation setup")
    Note: The map now contains a few buttons on the bottom right indicating a Polyline, Polygon, Rectangle, Circle, and a marker.

    3. Click on one of these 
    
    
    
    

    
    






Building options
----------------------------

### Get a static files folder which can be added to a web-server

-	with `grunt` all files are collected and build in a `dist` folder. The content of this folder can be deployed on a webserver like Tomcat.

### Build a .WAR file

-	with `grunt buildWar` a .WAR file is generated in the folder `build`. Use the .WAR file to deploy the client on a Web server.
