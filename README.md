wps-js-client
=============

Standalone Javascript OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) Client that utilizes the [wps-js](https://github.com/52North/wps-js) JavaScript API to grant access to Web Processing functionality via a user-friendly interface. It is built using JQuery, Boostrap and Angular and offers the following functions:

-	Configure available WPS instances
-	Use an intuitive HTML form-based Interface to build and execute typical request against WPS 1.0.0 and WPS 2.0.0 instances (GetCapabilities, DescribeProcess, Execute, getStatus, getResult)
-	Display of WPS responses via HTML form elements (Capabilities, ProcessDescription, Execute ResponseDocument (WPS 1.0), Execute ResultDocument (WPS 2.0), StatusInfo Document)

-	run `npm install` to get/install all dependencies
- run `grunt` or `grunt buildWar` to build the application (see section 'Building options' for more details)
-	Deploy it on a Web server (e.g. content from `dist` folder or as .WAR file as described above)
-	Launch the application and see what you can do.

Building options
----------------------------

### Get a static files folder which can be added to a web-server

-	with `grunt` all files are collected and build in a `dist` folder. The content of this folder can be deployed on a webserver like Tomcat.
