It is built using JQuery, Boostrap and Angular and offers the following functions:

-	Configure available WPS instances
-	Use an intuitive HTML form-based Interface to build and execute typical request against WPS 1.0.0 and WPS 2.0.0 instances (GetCapabilities, DescribeProcess, Execute, getStatus, getResult)
-	Display of WPS responses via HTML form elements (Capabilities, ProcessDescription, Execute ResponseDocument (WPS 1.0), Execute ResultDocument (WPS 2.0), StatusInfo Document)
